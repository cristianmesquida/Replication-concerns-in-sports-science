Inside the folder R scripts, there are two additional folders:
-	The folder Figures contains R code used to create every figure. 
-	The folder Z-curve contains two files:
I.	zcurve_protocol.docx contains the description of both the study selection protocol and how data was extracted and coded for the conduction of the z-curve analysis.
II.	zcurve_data.xlsx contains the sample of studies excluded and included as well as the data coded from the included studies for z-curve analysis.

The folder Analyses contains two R scripts: 
- power_calculations.r contains the R code and results for power calculations included as examples in the article. 
- zcurve.r contains the R code and results for the z-curve analysis.

The folder Simulations contains five R scripts: 
- simulation_fig1.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig.1
- simulation_fig2_7_8.R contains the R code and results of the simulations used in Fig.2, Fig.7 and Fig.8
- simulation_fig3.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig3.
- simulation_fig9.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig3.

Inside the folder Z-curve, there are two files:
- zcurve_data.xlsx contains a dataset generated for z-curve analysis (including the studies excluded). 
- zcurve_protocol.docx contains both the study selection protocol and description of how p-values reported in selected studies were extracted.
