README for Major replication concerns in sports science: a narrative review of key methodological issues in the field. 
Inside the folder R scripts, there are two additional folders:
-	The folder Figures contains R code used to produce each figure included in the article. 
-	The folder Z-curve contains two files:
I.	zcurve_protocol.docx contains the description of both the study selection protocol and how data was extracted and coded for the conduction of the z-curve analysis.
II.	zcurve_data.xlsx contains the sample of studies excluded and included as well as the data coded from the included studies for z-curve analysis.
-	The folder Analysis contains two R scripts: 
I.	power_calculations.r contains the R code and results for power calculations included as examples in the article. 
II.	zcurve.r contains the R code and results for the z-curve analysis.
-	The folder Simulations contains five R scripts: 
I.	simulation_fig1.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig.1
II.	simulation_fig2_7_8.R contains the R code and results of the simulations used in Fig.2, Fig.7 and Fig.8
III.	simulation_fig3.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig3.
IV.	Simulation_fig9.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig3.
Inside the folder Z-curve, there are two files:
I.	zcurve_data.xlsx contains a dataset generated for z-curve analysis (including the studies excluded). 
II.	zcurve_protocol.docx contains both the study selection protocol and description of how p-values reported in selected studies were extracted.
