Inside the folder R scripts, there are three additional folders:
- Figures contains R code used to create every figure. 
- Analyses contains two R scripts: 
       i) power_calculations.r contains the R code and results for power calculations included as examples in the article. 
       ii) zcurve.r contains the R code and results for the z-curve analysis.
- Simulations contains five R scripts: 
       i) simulation_fig1.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig.1
       ii) simulation_fig2_7_8.R contains the R code and results of the simulations used in Fig.2, Fig.7 and Fig.8
       iii) simulation_fig3.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig3.
       iv) simulation_fig9.R contains the R code and results of the simulation used in Fig3.

Inside the folder Z-curve, there are two files:
- zcurve_data.xlsx contains a dataset generated for z-curve analysis (including the studies excluded). 
- zcurve_protocol.docx contains both the study selection protocol and description of how p-values reported in selected studies were extracted.
